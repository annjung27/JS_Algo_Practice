# Big O of objects

Js objects

- unorderd, key value pairs

## Big O of objects

- Insertion: O(1) / constant time
- Removal: O(1) / constant time
- Object.keys(): O(N) / Linear time
- Objoect.values(): O(N) / Linear time
- Seaching: O(N)/ Linear time
- Accessing: O(1)/ constant time

when to use js objects to store your data...

- when you don't need order.
- when you need fast access by key value, and fast insertion and fast removal.
